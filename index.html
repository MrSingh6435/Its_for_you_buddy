                <span>
                    As my twenty-first birthday approaches, I've been reflecting on the people who have made a
                    significant
                    impact on my life, and you are undoubtedly one of the most important and cherished individuals. To
                    express my gratitude and appreciation, I would like to offer you a heartfelt gift that aligns with
                    your
                    interests.
                </span>
                <span>
                    Additionally, I want to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize if I have ever unintentionally
                    hurt
                    you. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I value the bond we share. I am grateful for your
                    presence
                    in my life, and I look forward to celebrating this milestone with you.
                </span>
                <span>
                    Thank you for being such a fantastic friend.

                            OS, which is Kali Linux Live. To make the USB bootable you need the iso file of the
                            operating system you want to install, a software that can help make the USB bootable and
                            most importantly a USB drive (Pendrive). The software I am using is Rufus. <a

                <p class="pera ans">Look, it depends on you what kind of hacking you want to do. But the basics are
                    always the same. The flow of learning is also the same. So first we have to start with Operating
                    System (Kali Linux), then Basics of Network, Programming, etc... Books I have arranged in order of
                    learning flow.</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="pera ans">Most of the penetration testers and white hat hackers prefer linux operating systems
                    such as Patric is, black arch, kali Linux over windows operating system because windows isn't an
                    open source and free to use, where as linux is an open source operation system in which user can
                    modify the os according to his needs and can also contribute his own softwares and tools for this
                    open source community. And also most of the hacking and cybersecurity tools are built for linux os

                <hr>
                <p class="pera ans">It's all your choice, I prefer bootable USB because now you're learning, and you
                    might accidentally damage your computer. I prefer it as a live USB to protect your PC from damage.
                    Once you learn, you can install it permanently in your computer.</p>
